# Feature Specification: Phase I – In-Memory Python Todo Console Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-console-todo-app`
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase I – In-Memory Python Todo Console ApplicationTarget outcome:A clean, maintainable Python 3.13+ command-line Todo app that stores tasks in memory and implements all 5 Basic Level features using Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.Core functionality:- Add Task (title, description)- View Task List (with status indicators)- Update Task (edit title/description)- Delete Task (by ID)- Mark Complete/IncompleteSuccess criteria:- All 5 basic features implemented exactly as defined- Runs entirely in the console using in-memory data structures- Clean Python project structure under /src- All code generated by Claude Code (no manual coding)- Repository includes: Constitution, specs history, source code, README.md, and CLAUDE.md- Code meets clean code principles and is fully reproducible from specsConstraints:- No external database; storage must be purely in-memory- Use UV + Python 3.13+- Only basic level features allowed in Phase I (no priorities, tags, search, reminders, etc.)- All implementation must follow iterative spec refinement until correctNot building:- Web frontend or REST API- Authentication or multi-user support- AI chatbot, MCP server, or Agents SDK- Kubernetes or cloud deployment"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add a new task (Priority: P1)
As a user, I want to add a new task with a title and description so that I can keep track of what I need to do.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental feature of a to-do application.

**Independent Test**: The user can add a task and see it in the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the to-do list is empty, **When** I add a new task with a title and description, **Then** the to-do list should contain one task with the given title and description, and a status of "incomplete".
2. **Given** the to-do list has existing tasks, **When** I add another task, **Then** the new task is added to the list.

### User Story 2 - View the list of tasks (Priority: P1)
As a user, I want to view all my tasks with their status so that I can see what I need to work on.

**Why this priority**: Viewing tasks is essential to using the application.

**Independent Test**: The user can view all added tasks and their statuses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** there are tasks in the to-do list, **When** I request to view the tasks, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their ID, title, description, and completion status.
2. **Given** the to-do list is empty, **When** I request to view the tasks, **Then** a message is displayed indicating that there are no tasks.

### User Story 3 - Update an existing task (Priority: P2)
As a user, I want to update the title and/or description of an existing task so that I can correct or change task details.

**Why this priority**: Allows for correcting mistakes and adapting to changing tasks.

**Independent Test**: The user can update a task and see the changes when viewing the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a task exists, **When** I update its title and description, **Then** the task's title and description are updated.
2. **Given** a task exists, **When** I update only its title, **Then** the title is updated and the description remains unchanged.

### User Story 4 - Delete a task (Priority: P2)
As a user, I want to delete a task so that I can remove completed or unnecessary items.

**Why this priority**: Keeps the to-do list clean and relevant.

**Independent Test**: The user can delete a task and it will no longer appear in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a task exists, **When** I delete it by its ID, **Then** the task is removed from the to-do list.
2. **Given** I try to delete a task with an ID that does not exist, **When** I attempt the deletion, **Then** an error message is displayed.

### User Story 5 - Mark a task as complete or incomplete (Priority: P1)
As a user, I want to mark a task as complete or incomplete so that I can track my progress.

**Why this priority**: Core to the concept of a to-do list.

**Independent Test**: The user can change the status of a task and see the updated status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a task is incomplete, **When** I mark it as complete, **Then** its status is updated to "complete".
2. **Given** a task is complete, **When** I mark it as incomplete, **Then** its status is updated to "incomplete".

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
