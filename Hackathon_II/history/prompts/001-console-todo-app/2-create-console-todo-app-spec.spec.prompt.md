## Prompt

/sp.specify Phase I – In-Memory Python Todo Console ApplicationTarget outcome:A clean, maintainable Python 3.13+ command-line Todo app that stores tasks in memory and implements all 5 Basic Level features using Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.Core functionality:- Add Task (title, description)- View Task List (with status indicators)- Update Task (edit title/description)- Delete Task (by ID)- Mark Complete/IncompleteSuccess criteria:- All 5 basic features implemented exactly as defined- Runs entirely in the console using in-memory data structures- Clean Python project structure under /src- All code generated by Claude Code (no manual coding)- Repository includes: Constitution, specs history, source code, README.md, and CLAUDE.md- Code meets clean code principles and is fully reproducible from specsConstraints:- No external database; storage must be purely in-memory- Use UV + Python 3.13+- Only basic level features allowed in Phase I (no priorities, tags, search, reminders, etc.)- All implementation must follow iterative spec refinement until correctNot building:- Web frontend or REST API- Authentication or multi-user support- AI chatbot, MCP server, or Agents SDK- Kubernetes or cloud deployment

## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification and the associated quality checklist. The feature is ready for the next phase.

- **Branch**: `001-console-todo-app`
- **Specification**: `specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md`
- **Checklist**: `specs/001-console-todo-app/checklists/requirements.md`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature specification has been created and is ready for planning.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 2 files were created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script failed repeatedly. I had to create the files manually.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script is not robust and fails with cryptic error messages when parsing arguments.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
